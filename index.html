		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/ProfilePic.jpg" class="left">
		<p class="paragraph">
		I grew up in La Grange, a south Chicago suburb. I went to Indiana University for my undergrad to study Finance. After Graduating I moved to Chicago and currently live in Wrigleyville.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">I currently work for Oracle as a Sr. Consultant in our Construction and Engineering Global Business Unit. My work entails building and managing our Mid-Atlantic business for a software called Textura. This entails selling and implementing new clients, managing existing clients, and growing our current book of business.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Outside of work some of my hobbies include playing video games, going to concerts and anything to do with sports. During the week I play in a mens basketball league and I'm currently training for the Chicago Marathon. I'm a huge Cubs, Blackhawks, Bears and Bulls fan.</p>
